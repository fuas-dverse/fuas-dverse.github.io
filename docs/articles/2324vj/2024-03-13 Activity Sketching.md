# Activity Sketching

- Clone the repo `https://github.com/fuas-dverse/activity-sketching`
- Make your own folder under `Projects`
- Create scenario outline
- List the agents or actors
- Write one or more scenes

Later you can export your cards as files and continue working on them by providing more detail and adding implementation notes. You can also still use the canvas.

## Example scenario outline

- I want to organise a bbq/party
	- Find a suitable date
		- I want some people to absolutely be there
		- I want to pick the date with the best weather prospects
		- Ask everyone to respond their availability for each date
			- No
			- Yes
			- Maybe
	- Send out invitations
	- Find nice recipes
		- Give some ingredients and ask for suggestions
	- Decide which recipes I want to make
		- Tell it the plan
		- Get shopping list
		- Tell it where I'm going to shop so it can help point me to sales, bundle the list per shop
	- Go shopping
		- Tick off what has been bought
		- Optionally add the amount
	- Create a playlist
	- Help cook the recipes
		- Plan what first, what later
	- Variation
		- I want my friends to each cook something and bring to the party
