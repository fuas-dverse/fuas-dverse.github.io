“Working on the DVerse project was a fun and engaging experience. I enjoyed the challenge of designing a system where multiple agents could work together in a modular and containerized way, instead of using a single monolithic codebase. Setting it up as a microservice-style architecture using NATS and separate containers for each provider made the system more flexible, scalable and easier to extend, and as someone who wants to continue working in the GenAI field it was good to know how to do this. It was rewarding to see how we could make agent communication work across services, and it taught me a lot about structuring AI systems in a scalable way.”

“I enjoyed working on the DVerse project, as it gave me the chance to learn about several AI topics which are becoming very relevant nowadays, including multi-agent systems, LLMs and smart ways of integrating all of this into advanced software systems. During our group project, we began with researching the context and the possible applications, all the way to finally developing a modular agentic framework from the group up. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that enabled to grow both technically and as a team member.”

“Before the beginning of the advanced software semester, I had some experience working on AI powered agents for my internship company, yet taking up the DVerse project felt like taking it to a whole new level. The beginning was certainly tough, making sense out of our stakeholder’s requirements, my current set of knowledge and the tools we had at hand seemed impossible. I took a while before we arrived at the somewhat conclusive idea of what my team and I imagined the DVerse platform would be, but the moment we had it planned out on the white board felt as if my motivation sprung to life again. It was a lengthy journey but one I am fond of and will come back to in the future.”

“The DVerse project served as my first introduction to AI integration in software development, providing an good opportunity to explore cutting-edge technologies that are increasingly important in today's landscape, particularly multi-agent systems, large language models, and their integration into software architectures. This experience has provided me a good foundation in AI-driven software development.”
