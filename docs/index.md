# DVerse

Public showroom for research and student projects on Digital Communities for the [Interaction Design research group](https://www.ixdfontysict.nl) (IXD) at the [Fontys University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fontys.nl). On this site we will share resources, concepts, projects and stories on Digital Communities (see [[News]] for a list of recent changes).

The DVerse project explores the building of digital places for local communities where diverse intelligences work together. We want to help such a communities' human members by offering simple and safe usage of bots (digital tools or intelligences).
