# DVerse

Public showroom for research and student projects on Digital Communities for the [Interaction Design research group](https://www.ixdfontysict.nl) (IXD) at the [Fontys University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fontys.nl). On this site we will share resources, concepts, projects and stories on Digital Communities (see [[News]] for a list of recent changes).

We strive to 

*increase the agency (doe-kracht) of community members by providing digital products and services (agents and things) that can be deployed into digital community platforms.*

By

*providing bonding, bridging and linking agents that are trusted and safe, that work well together, that have a very low bar of entry that enable groups and individuals to make social impact.*
