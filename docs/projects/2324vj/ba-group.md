## Description

Design a bot-enabled platform to enable anyone with access to the internet in the collaborating bot's interface to search for a specific question or task with a dynamic interaction between users and agents, in a secure way.

## Context

Our Bot Collaboration Platform project operates within the Digital Communities domain, focusing on enhancing user interactions through collaborative artificial intelligence (AI). This platform aims to leverage multiple bots working together to provide comprehensive responses to user queries, drawing information from diverse sources. The project is designed to address the growing demand for sophisticated digital assistants that can offer personalized, accurate, and timely information across various contexts, such as education and information retrieval.

## Results

An innovative system where multiple bots collaborate to provide users with comprehensive responses. For instance, a bot can search Google for relevant results and combine these with results from YouTube. Insights gathered from rigorous research methods have validated the value of this product, emphasizing user preference for bot-enabled platforms, the importance of security and trust, and the efficiency gains achievable. Positioned at TRL 7 and 6, respectively, this platform is well on its way to full-scale deployment and widespread adoption, offering significant benefits in the technology landscape.

### About the project group

In the sixth semester at Fontys, we created a group project called Dverse, an initiative of Marc van Grootel. The main goal of this project is to create a system where different agents can work together. Our individual projects included creating one or more agents that can complete tasks in the group project's system.
