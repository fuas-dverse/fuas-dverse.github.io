# Collaborative Team Game: COMMONS

You are the experience team. You develop an online version of the COMMONS game that is based on a social media platform that users can access and play via their mobile devices.

## Introduction

COMMONS (https://www.commons.nu) is a collaborative board game. It is used by teams to make complex decisions. By playing the game the group, together, arrives at the best solution for a problem. In the game players are stimulated to share their ideas and perspectives on a problem.

DVERSE (https://fuas-dverse.github.io) is a platform for human and machine intelligences. We strive to improve the quality of human social interaction through the use of machine intelligences.

This project is part of the Interaction Design research group and the Digital Communities program. This program is about human-centered, social design using digital technology and AI.
## Assignment

Together with the creators of COMMONS we proposed to develop their game on top of DVERSE.

The challenge is to develop modules, components or building blocks that, in the near future, can be used to build other collaborative games. We are trying to build a game development kit for games similar, or possibly even quite different, from COMMONS.

Your group will develop the backend and one or more frontends to play the game. The building blocks for the game may use AI agents, call external services or be as simple as rolling a die.

An important requirement is that the building blocks can be reused for future, new, games. In the first weeks of the project we will work with you to find out which part(s) to work on that fits your interests best.

## Tech Stack

 The students in the previous semester created a Dungeons & Dragons game platform which formed the inspiration for the current challenge. Their work can be used to get a head start with this semester's challenge.

Concepts used:

- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
- Fediverse
- ActivityPub

The tech stack that we worked with last semester:

- Python (but building blocks may use other languages too)
- Nats.io (message broker)
- AI frameworks and libraries
- Matrix server and Element client (communication and collaboration), Mastodon
